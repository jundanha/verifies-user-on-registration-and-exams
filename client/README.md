<p>There are some individuals that exploit the Dicoding system. So far, Dicoding only does email verification and we want to ensure each and every user, including what they do is legitimate. We created a face and gesture recognition system based on webcam-captured video images that covers
  1. Face verification and comparison on registration, starting exam, and project submission
  2. Real-time gesture recgnition and tracking on exam.  </p>
